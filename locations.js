They believed in a higher form of consciousness as the next evolutionary step to greatness and found a way to leave the body and exist ethereally.\nPlaying God is what The Sentinel called it. He believed God’s creatures were meant to be as created…connected to the earth and to the Creator.\nThe vast majority of the Mound Builders left their physical bodies behind and ignored the protestations of The Sentinel. He was told to stay behind and keep watch over their physical bodies, but it really was an empty gesture.\nThose who transformed themselves into pure consciousness did not know it, but without a purpose other than for themselves, their minds drifted then decayed into nothingness and were lost forever.\nWith his people, the knowledge they carried, and their culture all gone, The Sentinel was filled with grief. There was no one left. His only purpose now was to stand guard over the buried Crystal; the physical manifestation of the evil that destroyed everything he ever knew or loved.",

        "description": "A canal linking the Illinois River to Lake Michigan was first envisioned by Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet who traveled through the Des Plaines River Valley in 1672. By 1836, after years of planning, the first shovel broke ground in the creation of this great inland waterway and soon Midwest produce would be able to reach world markets. But before fortunes were made, hard labor had to be endured.\nIrish, Germans, and Scandinavians were among the groups that constructed the I&M Canal. Rock and tough soil along the ninety-six-mile canal was broken and moved entirely by hand. The workers lived in rude shanties, and many died of diseases, including cholera and dysentery. During the summer months, the men feared contracting malaria. Workers argued that hard liquor would protect them from disease and demanded that they be supplied with whiskey in order to work. In many cases canal workers were paid a dollar and a gill of whiskey per week. Whether the libation saved lives or not is unknown, but what is clear is that many thousands died in the construction of the canal.  \nFather John Raho, a missionary to the Irish community on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, wrote to his bishop, \"So many die that there is hardly any time to give Extreme Unction to everybody. We run night and day to assist the sick.\"\nWhat the workers didn’t know was the evil that was lurking below their feet. As they broke the soil to open a channel for the canal, they would soon unleash an evil that was never meant to see the light of day.",

Like one of thousands, Perkins worked long hours cutting through the wilderness with nothing more than hand tools. It was Perkins’ misfortune, however, to land the ill-fated stroke with his pick axe and uncover the Crystal so long ago buried by the Sentinel. It was immediately apparent to Perkins that what he uncovered was of great worth, so he took it back to Camp Dellwood and hid it in his tent. What he didn’t know was that it was the source of great evil and wrought destruction, not only on those who possessed it, but to the community they lived in as well.\nAt the time, Camp Dellwood was not yet the place of evil and despair that it would later become. It wasn’t until Milo brought the Crystal into the encampment that the slide into desolation began. While Perkins knew the Crystal had power and could be sold for profit, he found it difficult to part with it and kept it for many years. The destructive powers of the Crystal took everything from Milo: health, family, friends, and what little money he had. In the end, Milo bet and lost the Crystal in a desperate card game to Edward Talcott. Upon winning the Crystal, Talcott took the evil talisman back to Downtown Lockport and kept it in the Canal Commissioner’s office where he served as the Assistant to William Gooding, the Canal Commissioner. Soon after, Talcott died in a tragic accident along the Canal while inspecting the Lock; he slipped and fell between two barges and was crushed between them.\nIt was at this time that the Crystal came into William Gooding’s possession. With the Crystal now seated in Lockport’s power center, the evil began its nefarious work on the City itself.",

Rolling their wagons into town, sacks of grain with their family name on it would be sold or traded through a one on one transaction with locals.  Norton’s idea of a grain elevator was revolutionary. Building the largest limestone building in the State of Illinois, the Norton Grain Elevator was a first. Farmers came up to a scale house, had their grain weighed, then deposited it into a common hopper. Farmers were then issued “chits” while middlemen bickered and bartered over the price of grain, and, as such, the Chicago Board of Trade was born.\nFor the first time, men who never dirtied their hands with the soil made fortunes from farmers. It was not all one sided, of course. With the grain elevator and the Canal, farmers could reach markets as far away as New Orleans and New York. Everyone made their money.  \nNorton, like many of the other men of vision in Lockport, started off as a man who could both enrich himself and those around them. But as the years passed, and the evil influence of the Crystal spread throughout the City, men of means began to suffer a change of heart. A plutocracy was formed, a city run only by the rich. Selfish gain became the order of the day. By 1895, Norton Industries, a business empire that had its hand in every aspect of daily life, from foodstuffs to manufactured goods, controlled the markets. It was not to last however; when the Panic of 1896 hit, the foundation of Norton’s empire crumbled, and he would lose all.",

Norton & Co. became a major force in the region, owning the most canal boats and operating various mills and warehouses. Norton & Co. was the first in the country to switch from moving grain in sacks to transporting it in bulk via an elevator into boats."

The one exception was the Dance Hall located in the center of the camp.\nAs time wore on through the 1850’s and 60’s, the evil unknowingly brought to Camp Dellwood by Milo Perkins, began to transform the community into a true den of inequity. Gambling, brothels, and hard drinking took on new meaning. \nDuring the War Between the States and the North American – Siberian Airship Wars, Dellwood was frequented by press gangs that “recruited” men, and sometimes burly woman, for service. It was not uncommon for a resident to pass out in a muddy lane between the tents after a hard night drinking only to wake the next day at 2,500 feet altitude in an airship destined for war. In the early 1890’s, industrialists were the biggest users of press gangs who repurposed them to collect workers for trade ships destined for undesirable, yet profitable ports of call.",

Stephenson was the son of a local photographer who left for Europe at the age of 15 to study the science of physics. A brilliant prodigy who received advanced degrees from all of the major European Universities, he returned to Lockport only to fall into the debt of Charles Boyer when he lost a game of high stakes rummy. Boyer, seeing Stephenson’s potential to make him money as an inventor, built a secret laboratory for him on the third floor of his home.  Boyer told Stephenson he could work off his debt by providing him with at least one, good patent.  It was in this laboratory that Stephenson cracked the problem of time travel.  \nAfter a number of successful experiments with the fourth dimension, Stephenson was woken late one night by the Chrono-Keeper, Lorna. She explained that she was part of an organization that monitored disruptions in the timeline and to protect it from any accidental or intentional paradox. Lorna told him he had a choice to make: voluntarily destroy all evidence of his experiments and accompany her to the Chrono-Keepers compound for a debriefing or, she would destroy the lab and take him to the compound by force.\n”That’s hardly a choice,” he observed. But as Stephenson looked about the attic laboratory he was being held prisoner in, he decided at least it was a chance to escape. With no apparent modesty, Lorna removed her time harness from under her clothes and had Stephenson slide it over his head. As she adjusted the dial on the harness, he asked, “So this has the power to send both of us through time and space to your compound?”\n”Yes, as long as we are in close proximity.” Then Lorna pressed two buttons simultaneously and the suit began to create a tremendous power surge around the two of them. At that very moment, Lorna gave a Stephenson a violent push across the room and the last thing the startled scientist heard before disappearing was Lorna saying, “But I am not going with you.”\nLorna was about to violate the Chrono-Keeper’s cardinal rule: never interfere with the timeline.",

        "description": "As an enforcer for the Chrono Keepers, Lorna’s duty was very specific. Somewhere, someone here in Lockport had stumbled upon the dangerous secret of time travel. She was to find the person responsible for the time incursion and put a stop to them. Either they would be convinced to join the Chrono-Keepers or be eliminated. \nAfter having done dozens of these missions, she had developed her own system of infiltration. This time, however, something felt different; something she couldn’t put her finger on. There was more than someone flirting with time travel here: she sensed something deeper and more personal.\nAs she stood in the world of 1895, Lorna thought she heard a voice in the distance. She felt pulled in a direction that wasn’t about her mission. There was a current, a tide of emotion that dragged her deeper into the city. Lorna was drawn by this feeling into Camp Dellwood. \nThough appalled at the horrid living conditions in the Camp, she was more surprised at the people she came across. There didn’t seem to be a friendly face among the entire settlement. There was a startling lack of concern for one’s fellow human beings. No one showed any sign of caring for another, not even the simplest gesture. Poverty she was familiar with, but this feeling that anyone here could commit an atrocious crime at any minute, was not something she had experienced before. But she knew that somewhere in here was an answer. Then she saw him: a man speaking passionately to an apathetic crowd. His sense of purpose stood in stark contrast to anyone else she met in Camp Dellwood.",

While serving as a legislator in Springfield, he spoke at the State Assembly on behalf of the I&M Canal project and also for the location of Lockport as its headquarters. Once the I&M was approved, Mr. Boyer left politics and moved to Lockport to help supervise the building of the Canal. \nThere was some scandal involving an opulent home that was built across from the Canal Commissioner Headquarters by a man named Edward Talcott. Talcott served William Gooding as the assistant Canal Commissioner. Much gossip and grumbling came about because of the size of Talcott’s home, built on an assistant’s salary, and he was constantly harangued by the local newspaper editor, Styx McDonald, because of it. After Talcott’s untimely death, Boyer bought the home from his widow.  \nThe Boyer house, as it would be known to Lockport, was a peculiar home. His wife, the beautiful and spirited Elizabeth Runyon Boyer, used the first floor as a social salon, but strange lights and sounds often emanated from the home’s third floor windows. Charles out-lived his wife, and his children moved from Lockport, so when Mr. Boyer died, he left the home to the Lockport Woman’s Club. The ladies, knowing full well of the third floor’s bizarre reputation, hoped to uncover its secrets, but alas, all they found was a hodge-podge of mechanical parts purposefully destroyed. \nEventually the home was turned into the public library and was knocked down years later to be replaced by the modern library building. A large stone from the original home’s fence is all that remains and can be found on the north east corner of the property.",

She had a military look but wore an unfamiliar uniform. He stopped speaking, and no one noticed…except her. She walked toward him with boldness and asked him what he knew.\n“I know much,” he said. Lorna smiled slightly, “I believe you do.” When Lorna asked him if there was an event, a single cause for the despair in the city, Ichabod was astonished; this was the first time in his memory that anyone even cared to ask. \nGrabbing her hand, he drew her in. “Young lady, this is a city so drenched in evil, it no longer even knows it needs saving.” Then he said, “Let me tell you of the Crystal....”",

This move sparked the Lockport Commodities War of 1870. \nStarting with small skirmishes and vandalism by the two men’s hired hands, it soon elevated to the threat of all-out war with mercenary troops facing each other on the dolomite prairie located west of the City. Just as combat was about to be engaged by a thousand Joliet Toughs, hired as mercenaries by the House of Norton, against the hired Dellwood Guns of the House of Gaylord, a diplomatic intervention by Elizabeth Runyon Boyer saved the day.  \nThe Belle of Lockport courageously stood between the opposing armies and called the two rivals to task. Compromises were agreed upon, and the grain business in Lockport continued with little more than the two captains of industry staring grimly at each other from their office windows.",

While digging in the coal shales on the banks of Mazon Creek in 1855, Tully uncovered a prehistoric marine animal that had yet to be discovered by science. On one end, the creature had terrifying jaws, and on the other, an entirely second head with a long snout like an elephant.  \nTully kept the strange specimen in his Lockport home for many years. When the Field Museum was founded in 1893 during the Columbian Exposition, Tully brought his find to the curator of fossil invertebrates, E.S. Richardson, for an opinion.  \nRichardson, nor any of his colleges, had seen anything like it before. “We weren’t even sure what phylum to classify it in,” he told the press. After much debate, the great minds of the paleontological world bestowed the name Tullimonstrum Gegarium on the fossil. Most people, however, choose to call the creature by its common name; the Tully Monster. \nThe Illinois State Legislature designated Tullimonstrum Gregarium as the State fossil in 1895.",

One of the startling aspects of the area that greeted the first pioneers was the abrupt change in landscape: heavy, old growth woods grew on the east side of the Des Plaines River, while nothing but open prairie stretched to the horizon on the west side. It was clear that the soil and climate of northern Illinois were ideal for farming, but the obstacle faced by the early planters was breaking through the tough Midwestern sod.\nBesides being a farmer, John Lane was also an innovative blacksmith. Cutting and shaping metal from saw blades, he was able to build the first steel plow. It was an innovation that would transform farming because, for the first time, vulnerable wooden blades would be replaced by no-nonsense steel. This invention greatly increased farm productivity and with the construction of the I&M Canal, Midwest farmers would be able to load their grains on barges for distant ports. They soon became the bread basket for the nation.       \nJohn Lane, being a selfless man, built his steel plows and gave them to his neighbors free of charge. His generosity was played upon, however, by a visitor named John Peer, who always wore a strange yellow and green suit. Inquiring about the free plows, Mr. Lane was providing to local farmers, Peer presented himself as new arrival in Lockport interested in starting a farmstead. Through this deception, he acquired one of Lane’s plows. Mr. Peer took the invention, patented the design, and built an industrial empire selling the plow under his name.",

His invention, which he initially produced on his farm and later in Lockport, became known as the 'Lockport Clipper' and 'Sod Breaker'.

Flying just high enough to avoid gunshot range, men of the Air Corp dropped long fused explosive charges upon the enemy ranks and won the day. After the War, flight technology and air warfare progressed exponentially. By the time of the North American – Siberian Airship Wars, death in the air was a perfected art.",

Marie opened a woman’s boutique on the first floor, called Worldly Things, which became a sensation. \nThe boutique was well known in Chicagoland not only for carrying the latest fashions, but for Marie’s impeccable eye. The rich and famous ladies of the day came to be outfitted by Mrs. Cook and her opinion on style was always the last. \nNot forgetting her humble beginnings, “Cookie” as she was known by most, repurposed older clothing and gave it to those in need.",

Outdoor photography, such as that done during the War Between the States, was often staged and highly controlled. This, of course, was due to the long exposure times required by the medium. \nBy the end of the century though, advances in technology allowed for far smaller cameras that didn’t require bulky tripods and had far shorter exposure times. While H.H. Carter didn’t invent the technology, he certainly used it to its full potential. \nWalking the streets of Lockport, Carter captured candid street scenes filled with smiling people and spontaneous poses. As Carter’s work focused on daily life, his work was a very popular with everyday folks. His photographs were displayed in the Illinois State Museum for all to see and now his collection resides in Lewis University’s archives. \nDuring the North American – Siberian Airship Wars, Carter was the Army’s designated field photographer. Unfortunately, his work was destroyed when an over-eager assistant accidently exposed all of his film in a rush to develop the images.",

Her favorite quote was, “Anyone who has an opinion on a problem without presenting a solution is nothing more than a whiner.”  \nHer reputation outside of Lockport didn’t take root until after the death of her husband. Once she became a widower, Fox made no bones about the fact that she was sick of the endless bickering by the grey beards of the City. So, at age 73, the feisty widow left public service to pursue her true passion: High Adventure. \nJumping aboard an airship bound for overseas, Fox became one of the great explorers of the century. Her pluck earned her positions on dangerous expeditions ranging from Carsten Borchgrevink’s Southern Cross Adventure in Antarctica to Hiram Bingham’s discovery of Machu Picchu. \nGladys never returned to Lockport, but she was fondly remembered by all that knew her. For many years after her departure, she would send the school children of the city detailed letters of her adventures. Her letters and travel gear can be found at the Gladys Fox Museum.",

I’ve seen it myself.” Stepping closer, he added, “I’d be happy to take you there.” Lorna strongly pushed Singer away, and he stumbled back, falling into the street.\nLorna turned to Jax. “Did you see his eyes?” she asked. He nodded as he watched Singer dust himself off and disappear into the crowd. With exasperation, she explained that something evil had a grip on this city, and it was tied to the Crystal in Gooding’s office. Jax agreed that something odd was going on, but…\nBefore he could finish, Lorna started to run. Catching up with her, he had to physically restrain her to get her to explain her actions. She said she was going to destroy the Crystal.\nJax told her to think this through. What was the plan? Break into a private office and smash it? Who’s to say that would actually solve anything, or what if it made matters worse? Maybe nothing would happen and the two of them would be arrested. This is the kind of impulsive behavior that… he didn’t get to finish. Lorna simply looked at Jax and asked, very directly, if he would help her or not. With a sigh, Jax let his feelings for Lorna push all logic aside. “Yes,” he said. “I will help you.”",

Back-breaking work done with spade and barrow was replaced by powerful steam shovels and controlled ordinance that blew rock walls into pebbles. When the Sanitary and Shipping Canal was built in the 1890’s to replace the aging and undersized I&M Canal, a new breed of laborer was born. \nThough the work was still arduous, newly invented equipment allowed construction on a scale never before seen. A deep water channel was cut from Lake Michigan to the Illinois River that could accommodate barges of enormous size. Terrific engines where invented to push product across the nation by the most efficient means possible: water. \nNot welcome, at the time, was the fact the Shipping Canal was also a Sanitary Canal; part of the reason it was built was to float Chicago’s raw sewage away from their city and lakefront to the interior water ways. Downstream communities, including Lockport, were in an uproar, claiming the stench would be unbearable. Chicago advocates of the Sanitary and Shipping Canal claimed the passage downstream would purify the sewage long before it reached any inland city of consequence. Neighboring Great Lake States claimed that the great channel would drain Lake Michigan and turn it into a the “great mud puddle.” \nLawsuits were filed, though work continued, until all that remained to complete the project was the demolition of a small wooden dam separating the waters of Lake Michigan from the newly dug canal. In the dark of night, someone blew the dam and the waters flowed, reversing the flow of the Chicago River. Commerce commenced and Chicagoans began floating “special gifts” to their neighbors downriver.",

Just before she reached the ground, Jax leapt to help cushion her fall. He carried her to a spot away from onlookers and into some shade. He felt for her pulse, and it was strong. Her eyes fluttered as if in a dream, but he could not wake her. Without opening her eyes, she whispered that she was not in danger and told Jax to just leave her be for a moment. \nThe Sentinel spoke in her mind, and it was with the same soft disembodied voice she heard when she arrived in Lockport. He told her that he was one of the original Mound Builders, and it was he who, long ago, vanquished the same evil they are experiencing now. He told Lorna of his people’s desire to leave their physical form, a desire he fought against during his lifetime. \nAfter the death of his people, he chose to stay and guard the evil, but had to battle his grief and despair every day. As his body aged, he realized he could not guard forever, so he used his people’s technology to separate the spirit from the body. Now he only existed in this form as pure thought. \nWhen the evil was unburied, he was aware, but was unable to do anything about it without a physical body. When Lorna arrived, he felt something he had not felt in uncountable generations…a kinship. He thought it impossible, for he believed all of his people had perished, but he was sure she was a distant relation of the Mound Builders! When he found she could hear him if he spoke in her mind, he was certain.",

The land was owned by the County of Will and considered “open lands” where anyone could settle without cost or title. It remained so until it was sold to John Sears to fill a budget hole in the county’s finances. \nAs it was primary a camp for transient workers, few permanent structures were built on the property so the camp was never more than a ramshackle, haphazard community of tents and scraps. The one exception was the Dance Hall located in the center of the camp.\nAs time wore on through the 1850’s and 60’s, the evil unknowingly brought to Camp Dellwood by Milo Perkins, began to transform the community into a true den of inequity. Gambling, brothels, and hard drinking took on new meaning. \nDuring the War Between the States and the North American – Siberian Airship Wars, Dellwood was frequented by press gangs that “recruited” men, and sometimes burly woman, for service. It was not uncommon for a resident to pass out in a muddy lane between the tents after a hard night drinking only to wake the next day at 2,500 feet altitude in an airship destined for war. In the early 1890’s, industrialists were the biggest users of press gangs who repurposed them to collect workers for trade ships destined for undesirable, yet profitable ports of call.",

The Sentinel said the only people in those days who knew about time travel were his own, and if there was someone protecting time, perhaps a small group DID survive the cataclysm and formed a policing unit. As they shared each other’s memories, it was clear the Sentinel’s theory was true. Something else was clear; not only were they kinsman, but Lorna and the Sentinel shared a common destiny. They were both tasked with containing the evil of this place. He told her she needed to bury the crystal again, and that he would guide her to do just that.\nLorna sat up fully awake and told Jax about her vision. He was at a loss for words, but that was not unusual for this mission. She asked Jax if he would be at her side until the end, no matter the outcome. As a soldier, Lorna had always wanted his approval, but she now opened up her heart to reveal deeper feelings. She took Jax’s outstretched hand as he helped her to her feet. “What do we need to do?” He asked.\n“We need to go retrieve the Crystal in the Commissioner’s office,” she said. \n“Ok,” said Jax, nodding. His was mind already forming a plan on how to get past Gooding’ security team. “I will get us in.”",

        "description": "They had found the Crystal in Gooding’s office like they were told. While Jax held off Gooding’s security, Lorna took the Crystal. Twenty minutes later, they rendezvoused on the edge of town in the Lockport Cemetery and placed the Crystal on the ground. The Sentinel communicated to Lorna that her staff was more than just a family heirloom; it had the power to bury the Crystal. Reaching into her mind, he showed Lorna how to channel her spirit into the staff.  As Lorna held it aloft, it glowed with a bright yellow-white light. A streak of lightning shot forth and struck the Crystal, which then produced its own red energy. The staff’s power began to force the Crystal into the earth below, but the evil inside fought back. With the Sentinel guiding her, Lorna focused both of their spirits and forced the Crystal down until the earth enveloped it. They left a nondescript marker over the spot.\nAs Jax helped an exhausted Lorna back to town, they noticed that people seemed different already. They experienced a couple raised hats and greetings of hello: something unheard of when the Crystal was exposed. On the outskirts of Camp Dellwood, they sat on a grassy hill, and a woman offered them some water, which they accepted graciously. Clearly, with the Crystal buried, an unseen darkness had been lifted. \n“I need to stay here, Jax,” Lorna said. “I am the new Sentinel.”\n“I figured as much,” he said. “You realize that they will send a team to try and bring us back?” She told him she didn’t care. Her duty was now clear and she was to remain here. She said she didn’t want Jax to leave but understood if he felt he had to.\n “Who said anything about leaving?” He said. Then, removing the power cell from his time harness, he smashed it on a rock. Jax would not leave the only person he had ever loved, no matter if her responsibilities were bigger than the both of them. With his arm about her, he added, “If the Keepers come for us, logic dictates that we will handle them better together then alone.” \n“Logic?” she laughed. Together they sat on that hill for a long time.",
